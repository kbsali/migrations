.. php:class:: OffsetResolver

    Class OffsetResolver.

    Resolves aliases in the format: ID{OPERATOR}[COUNT]

    Operators:
         +           will add
         -, ^ or ~   will subtract

    Repeat operators consecutively works as a shortcut for COUNT. E.g. ++ will set COUNT to 2.

    Count (optional) should be a number if present and takes precedence over the previous rule.

    Example aliases: 123+, 123++ (same as 123+2), 123+++9 (will be simplified to 123+9)
